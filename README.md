# Algorithm Trading

These Python scripts are designed to perform numerous calculations on financial market data from the MetaTrader API and place trades.

They query the API for raw price data, then calculate things like moving averages, relative strength index, and Bollinger bands. 

When a combination of a few particular metrics shows a well-known technical pattern which draws trading volume, the programs will actually place the trades automatically!

Support & Resistance Levels
